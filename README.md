# Project 3 - U.S. Senator Stock Market Data

## Git Ignore
- Add files here that are specific to your system during runs/debugs or the compiler
- e.g. settings.json

## Main
- Prints out a menu and reads in the commands from the user
- getline is used intstead of operator>> to handle each iteration of the while loop

## Plans
- Create function to calculate percentage correct of investments or something similar
- Name similarity checker? Makes names easier to search
